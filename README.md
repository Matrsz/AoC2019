# AoC2019
My solutions for https://adventofcode.com/2019

## Pending Tasks: 

- Move the Intcode computer into a proper library instead of copying the exact same code into every Intcode problem.

- Review the code to remove unnecessary imports and unused functions, etc

- Add notes on particularly interesting problems, for example
  - Day 14: Space Stochiometry
  - Day 18: Many-Worlds Interpretation
  - Day 9: Sensor Boost

- There's some problems that I'd like to review, for instance
 - Day 6: Universal Orbit Map. My solutions are awfully slow, and they do not need to be. This is largely due to my unfamiliarity with Haskell.
 - Day 17: Set and Forget. I'd like to implement a proper zip algorithm instead of hardcoding the solution for part 2.
